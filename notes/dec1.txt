Generating data for varying scenarios

SETUP:
run files to generate 1000 sets of data, sweeping through values or just using a single value? and maybe 5 trials of each value

MODELS:
- Jensen
- Multi-zone wake
- Gaussian wake
- Curl model

Analysis of ease of data generation

Test FLORIS default controllers

Read some papers to compare to experience
- floris paper on zotero

NEXT STEP: read model-free RL paper and code up somethign for that

is the goal to get data that is optimized or data that we will then try to find an optimal thing from while learning controls? how many realistic scenarios do we need for this?

how to select parameters for model map? 

preference for turbine - paper used DTU 10mw



fix yaw and get cleaner data
turbine doesn't really matter - nrel 5MW is fine
pare down to basics - default configs generally work
get a working example in one file
just pick one wake model -> can vary later
-> pay attention to which is generating complex behavior 
github copilot, cursor is an option for a framework to get started - make sure i understand what it's doing

NEXT STEPS:
- RL approaches
- goal is still to identify how difficult this task is (deficit between what's done adn what we can offer)
- application of method or family of methods from some domain to this one is a valid contribution
