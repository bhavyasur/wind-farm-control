  # Listing of turbine types for placement at the x and y coordinates.
  # The list length must be 1 or the same as ``layout_x`` and ``layout_y``. If it is a

  # is mapped to the location at the same index in ``layout_x`` and ``layout_y``.
  # The types can be either a string for a turbine included in the turbine_library,
  # a string beginning with !include for a path to the user's turbine; or a full
  # definition of a wind turbine (as a nested dictionary).

  # The height in meters to consider the "center" of the vertical wind speed profile
  # due to shear. With a shear exponent not 1, the wind speed at this height
  # will be the value given in ``wind_speeds``. Above and below this height,
  # the wind speed will change according to the shear profile; see
  # :py:meth:`.FlowField.initialize_velocity_field`.
  # For farms consisting of one wind turbine type, use ``reference_wind_height: -1``
  # to use the hub height of the wind turbine definition. For multiple wind turbine
  # types, the reference wind height must be given explicitly. Float type (or -1).
