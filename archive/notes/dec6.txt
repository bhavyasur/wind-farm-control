reading thru introconcepts.ipynb on floris repository.

1. Load inputs and preprocess data
2. Run the wind farm wake calculation
3. Extract data and postprocess results

main things to change in data:
yaw angle
typical wind conditions 

wake profile = velocity deficit profile behind wind turbine + potential additioanl model for effect of yaw misalignment

need to look into whether the uncertain floris model is worth using - keeps wind direction and speed consistent, simply adds uncertainty into direction at steady state
